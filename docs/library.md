# Library & Playlists

Your saved tracks, albums, followed artists, and playlists — all listable, mutable, and pipeable.

## library tracks

```bash
spogo library tracks list [--limit N]
spogo library tracks add <id|url...>
spogo library tracks remove <id|url...>
```

`add`/`remove` accept multiple IDs or URLs in one call:

```bash
spogo library tracks add \
  spotify:track:7hQJA50XrCWABAu5v6QZ4i \
  https://open.spotify.com/track/4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8
```

## library albums

```bash
spogo library albums list [--limit N]
spogo library albums add <id|url...>
spogo library albums remove <id|url...>
```

## library artists

```bash
spogo library artists list [--limit N] [--after <artist-id>]
spogo library artists follow <id|url...>
spogo library artists unfollow <id|url...>
```

`--after` paginates by artist ID — pass the last ID from the previous page to fetch the next.

## library playlists

```bash
spogo library playlists list [--limit N]
```

Lists every playlist you own or follow. To list **tracks** in a playlist, use `playlist tracks` below.

## playlist create

```bash
spogo playlist create "Road Trip"
spogo playlist create "Team Mix" --public
spogo playlist create "Shared Notes" --collab
```

`--public` marks the playlist as discoverable; `--collab` makes it editable by collaborators (collaborative playlists must be private).

## playlist add / remove

```bash
spogo playlist add <playlist> <track...>
spogo playlist remove <playlist> <track...>
```

`<playlist>` is a playlist ID, `spotify:playlist:...` URI, `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...` URL, or **the playlist name** if you own it. Tracks accept the same flexible forms as `library tracks add`.

```bash
spogo playlist add "Road Trip" \
  spotify:track:7hQJA50XrCWABAu5v6QZ4i \
  spotify:track:0sf12qNH5qcw8qpgymFOqD

spogo playlist remove 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M spotify:track:7hQJA50XrCWABAu5v6QZ4i
```

Playlist mutations route through Connect by default — Connect avoids the Web API rate limits that bite when you script bulk add/remove. spogo automatically detects writable playlists and falls back to Web API where Connect can't help.

## playlist tracks

```bash
spogo playlist tracks <playlist> [--limit N]
```

Lists the items inside a playlist:

```bash
spogo playlist tracks "Road Trip" --plain | head
spogo playlist tracks 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M --json | jq '.tracks[].name'
```

## Common patterns

### Save the currently playing track

```bash
id=$(spogo status --json | jq -r '.item.id')
spogo library tracks add "$id"
```

### Build a playlist from a search

```bash
spogo playlist create "Lo-Fi Coding"
spogo search track "lo-fi" --limit 20 --plain |
  awk '{print $1}' |
  xargs spogo playlist add "Lo-Fi Coding"
```

### Snapshot all liked tracks to a file

```bash
spogo library tracks list --limit 1000 --json > liked-tracks.json
```

### Remove duplicates from a playlist

```bash
spogo playlist tracks "Road Trip" --plain |
  awk '{print $1}' |
  sort | uniq -d |
  xargs -I {} spogo playlist remove "Road Trip" {}
```

## Errors

- **`playlist not found`** — confirm spelling, or pass the URI/URL instead of the name.
- **`not collaborative`** — only owners and explicitly added collaborators can mutate a playlist.
- **`429 too many requests`** — should not happen with Connect; if you see it on `web`, switch engines or insert a sleep.

See [Engines](engines.md) and [Output](output.md) for output and engine details.
