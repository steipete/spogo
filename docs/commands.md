# Command Reference

Hand-written index of every `spogo` subcommand. The fully normative spec lives in [spec.md](spec.md); this page is the readable browse.

For deeper guides, see [Auth](auth.md), [Playback](playback.md), [Library](library.md), [Queue](queue.md), [Devices](devices.md), [Engines](engines.md), and [Output](output.md).

## library

Saved tracks, albums, followed artists, owned/followed playlists. See [Library](library.md).

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spogo library tracks list [--limit N]` | List saved tracks. |

| `spogo library tracks remove <id|url...>` | Unsave tracks. |

## user

Read-only listening data from Spotify's web endpoints.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spogo user top-tracks [--period all-time|year|6mo|month|week|day] [--limit N] [--offset N]` | Show affinity-ranked top tracks. |
| `spogo user history [--period all|year|6mo|1mo|1wk|1day] [--limit N] [--after <ms>] [--before <ms>]` | Show recently played tracks available from Spotify. |

Spotify limitations are surfaced rather than hidden:

- Top tracks are Spotify affinity rankings, not play counts.
- Spotify only supports `long_term`, `medium_term`, and `short_term` top-track windows. `year` maps to `long_term`; `6mo` maps to `medium_term`; `month` and `week` map to `short_term` (roughly 4 weeks); `day` returns an explicit unsupported-period error.
- Recently played is not a complete historical archive. Spotify returns retained recent plays only, at up to 50 items per page; spogo paginates backward with `before` cursors and stops at a 200-item client cap. Periods and `--after` are local lower-bound filters over the items Spotify returns.

## playlist

Mutate playlists. See [Library](library.md).

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spogo playlist create <name> [--public] [--collab]` | Create a new playlist. |
| `spogo playlist add <playlist> <track...>` | Append tracks. |
| `spogo playlist remove <playlist> <track...>` | Remove tracks. |
| `spogo playlist tracks <playlist> [--limit N]` | List a playlist's items. |

`<playlist>` accepts a playlist ID, URI, URL, or owned-playlist name.

## device

Connect devices. See [Devices](devices.md).

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spogo device list` | List Connect-visible devices. |
| `spogo device set <name|id>` | Transfer playback to a device. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Generic failure |
| `2` | Invalid usage / validation |
| `3` | Auth / cookies missing or invalid |
| `4` | Network / timeouts |

See [Output](output.md) for the full output contract.
